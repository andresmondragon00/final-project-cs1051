We learned how to use Python Libraries such as Folium and Pandas, this was the most challenging part of the whole project. Before you try running the project, make sure you install these libraries (we used pip install folium and pip install pandas in the python terminal).

We also learned how to apply the concepts we learned from the webpage assignment from CS50 to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We also did some research on how to make this page interactive, that’s when we came up with the idea of using Folium to generate maps and find the coordinates for each of the places we used in the assignment.
